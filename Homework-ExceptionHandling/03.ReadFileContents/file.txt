Problem 3. Read file contents

Write a program that enters file name along with its full file path (e.g. C:\WINDOWS\win.ini), reads its contents and prints it on the console.
Find in MSDN how to use System.IO.File.ReadAllText(…).
Be sure to catch all possible exceptions and print user-friendly error messages.
